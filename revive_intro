IntroductionMany thought leaders point out major theories and ideas as to how digital has impacted business, the economy, and society. That’s helpful, but this book will do that and more. It will show you “how to” transform or build a core business model that is ready for the digital age. This is not a book about chasing the latest technology, but instead it is a book on strategy, business models, and the art and science of creating your own digital transformation. Our goal is to help you change the game before it changes you, while providing you with the initial thought processes, guidance, and “how-to” so you can.Digital is about immediacy—about getting the word out, and making changes. Oddly enough, the digital transformation process itself can take years—especially if you have a large company. Why? Because it’s not just your business model that may need to change. It’s also your people, your technology platforms, and your operational processes that also have to change. Conceiving a new business model and implementing a technology capable of disrupting your industry is only part of the challenge. It’s harder to create the teams, the processes and the change that the new technology and model requires. But we will show you how to do that too.Today, companies are asking most often how to drive the kind of change that will get them noticed, that will put them ahead in their industry and that will make them the next great case study. Are you debating, embarking on a major transformation? Are you worried about whether the idea, or the risk of change will fly in your current company culture? Today, conservative and cautious can kill your long-term opportunities. If you do nothing else around digital transformation this year, read this book. At minimum, it should help you recognize digital disruptions that will be or are a threat to your business, similar to relatively recent examples outlined in Figure 0.1.
